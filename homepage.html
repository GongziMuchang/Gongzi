						<p>Erastothenes is the oldest of these four famous scientists. He lived in ancient Greece. 
						He was a mathematician, an astronomer and a geographer.</p>
						<p>Erastothenes is best known for being the first person to measure the circumference of the 
						Earth. He was the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. He was the father of chronology,
						which is the science of finding out how old are things from long ago. As a mathematician,
						he primarily worked with prime numbers. He was the father of geography, which is the science that 
						studies the Earth.</p>

						<p>Galileo is the second oldest of these four famousscientists. He lived in Italy in the 
						16th and 17th centuries during the Renaissance era. He was a physicist and an astronomer.</p>
                        			<p>Galileo is best known for being the father of modern science, which is centered around the 
						scientific method. The scientific method is the foundation of modern science. Using the 
						scientific method, scientific knowledge are obtained by experimentation and observation. 
						As a physicist, he worked with force and acceleration. A famous experiment that he did was 
						dropping two balls, one lighter and one heavier, from the top of the leaning tower of Pisa 
						and proving that heavier things do not fall faster than lighter things. As an astronomer, 
						he invented the telescope. He used it to observe the phases of Venus and the moons of Jupiter 
						to provide evidence for the heliocentric theory.</p>

						<p>Newton is the third oldest of these four famous scientists. He lived in England in the 17th 
						and 18th centuries during the Enlightenment era. He was a mathematician and a physicist.</p>
                        			<p>As a physicist, he is best known for his work with force and acceleration. His three laws of 
						motion and his law of universal gravitation form the foundation of classical mechanics, which 
						helped explain how celestial bodies moved around each other in space. As a mathematician, he 
						pioneered calculus, which is the mathematical study of continuous change. Calculus enables 
						precise modeling of physical phenomena, and it is today an indispensable tool in science and 
						engineering with wide applications in our daily lives.

						<p>Planck is the most recent of these four scientists. He lived in Germany in the 19th and 20th 
						centuries. He was a physicist who won the Nobel prize in physics in 1918.</p>
                        			<p>As a theoretical physicist, Planck is best known for pioneering quantum physics, which is the 
						theoretical basis of modern physics that explains the nature and behavior of matter and energy 
						on the atomic and subatomic level. He is also known for obtaining the Planck constant h, 
						Planck's law, the Planck units, and the Planck-Einstein relation E = hv. This equation, which 
						he obtained together with Albert Einstein, who was another great scientist from Germany, plays 
						an integral role in quantum mechanics.
