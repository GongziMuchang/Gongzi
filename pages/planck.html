						<p>Max Planck was a German physicist scientist who lived in the 19th and 20th centuries. He was born
						on 23 April 1858 in the city of Kiel in Germany, and he died on 4 October 1947 in the city of Göttingen 
						in Germany. 
						</p>						
						<p>						
						As a physicist, he worked in the field of theoretical physics. He pioneered quantum physics,
						which revolutionized our undertanding of the atomic and subatomic world. In 1918, he was awarded the Nobel 
						Prize in Physics. Today, the Max Planck Society operates 83 institutions that do scientific research in
						a wide range of scientific fields.

						<p>
						Planck formulated the Planck postulate, which says that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in
						quantized form. Written mathematically, it says that<br>E = n&#8462&nu;, where E is the energy of a
						particular electromagnetic radiation, n is some natural number, &#8462 is Planck's constant, and &nu; is 
						that particular electromagnetic radiation's frequency. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Together with Albert Einstein, Planck formulated the Planck–Einstein relation, which says that the energy of a particular 
						electromagnetic radiation's photons is proportional to that particular electromagnetic radiation's frequency. Written 
						mathematically, it says that E = &#8462&nu;, where E is the energy of a particular electromagnetic radiation's photons, 
						&#8462 is Planck's constant, and &nu; is that particular electromagnetic radiation's frequency.
