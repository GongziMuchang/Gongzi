						<p>Erastothenes lived in ancient Greece. He was born in 276 BC in Cyrene, Libya, and he died in
						194 BC in Alexandria, Egypt. He was a famous mathematician, geographer, and astronomer.

						<p>As a mathematician, Eratosthenes worked with prime numbers. He obtained the Sieve of Erastothenes, which is a method for finding all the prime numbers 
						up to any number. To learn about the Sieve of Erastothenes, click the picture below.

						<p>As a geographer, he measured the circumference of the Earth. He did so in Alexandria, Egypt by using angles and proportions. 
						He measured the angle of the shadow made by 
						a tower in Alexandria at noon on the longest day of the year, which he found to be 7.2 degrees. 
						On same day at the same time in the city of Syene in Greece, the sun was directly overhead at 
						90 degrees, because it was shining straight down into a well. A circle is 360 degrees, so 7.2 
						degrees is 1/50 of a circle. He multiplied the distance between Syene and Alexandria by 50 to 
						obtain a value of about 40,000 kilometers for the circumference of the Earth, which is 
						remarkably close to the value of 40,075 kilometers obtained using today's technologies.
