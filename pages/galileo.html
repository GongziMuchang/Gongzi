						<p>Galileo Galilei lived in Italy during the Renaissance. He was born on 15 February 1564 in 
						the city of Pisa, Italy, and he died on 8 January 1642 in the city of Arcetri, Italy. He was a 
						famous physicist and astronomer.
						</p>
						<p>As a physicist, he worked with force and acceleration, and pioneered the scientific method. 
						The scientific method is the foundation of modern science. Using the scientific method, 
						scientific knowledge are obtained by experimentation and observation. As an astronomer, he 
						invented the telescope, and used it to discover many astronomical bodies, including moons of 
						Jupiter.

						Galileo used his inclined plane experiment to obtain the 
						constant acceleration of objects in free fall. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Because the speeds of falling objects were too fast to be measured in Galileo's days, he rolled 
						balls down inclined planes and recorded the relation between the distances the balls traveled 
						and the times the balls took. After many experimental trials, he found that, for a ball 
						traveling down an inclined plane, doubling the time it travels results in four times the distance 
						it travels. Objects in free fall accelerate at a constant rate. This rate is the constant g, having a value of about 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

						<p>
						Galileo used his leaning tower of Pisa experiment to 
						demonstrate that heavier objects do not necessarily fall faster than lighter objects.
						</p>
						<p>
						The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that the heavier an object is, the faster
						it falls, and vice versa. For millenia, this was believed to be true. In 1589, Galileo did an 
						experiment to test Aristotle's theory by dropping two balls from the top of the leaning tower 
						of Pisa. The two balls had the same shape and material, except one was heavier and the 
						other was lighter. Galileo dropped both balls at the same time, and both balls landed 
						on the ground at the same time. He demonstrated that the speed at which an object 
						falls is not related to its weight.

						As an astronomer, Galileo invented the telescope. He used it to make remarkable astronomical 
						discoveries.
						</p>
						<p>
						In 1608, the spyglass, which magnifies an object by a few times, appeared in Europe. Galileo's telescope, 
						invented in 1610, consists of a hollow cylinder with a spyglass at both ends, one convex and the other concave. Galileo's telescope 
						can magnify a distant object by 30 times.
						</p>
						<p>
						Using his telescope, Galileo observed that the Moon has a rough surface rather than a 
						smooth surface that people once believed, and he discovered the four largest moons of 
						Jupiter that are now known as the Galilean moons. His observations of the phases of Venus provided evidence for the 
						heliocentric theory proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543.
