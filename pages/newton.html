						<p>Isaac Newton lived in England during the Enlightenment. He was born on 25 December 1642 
						in Woolsthorpe Manor, and died on 20 March 1727 in London. He was a famous, physicist,
						mathematician and astronomer.
						</p>
						<p>As a physicist, he worked with force and acceleration, discovered gravity, and discovered
						properties of visible light. As a mathematician, he formulated calculus, which is the branch of 
						mathematics that solves problems that involve continuous change. As an astronomer, he invented
						the reflecting telescope and studied comets.

						<p>As a physicist, Newton discovered what are now known as Newton's laws of motion. The first law says 
						that an object has inertia, and it remains at rest or moves at a constant speed straight ahead unless 
						a force acts on it. The second law says that an object has momentum, and the heavier it is, the faster 
						it accelerates when a force acts on it, and vice versa. The third law says that that an object reacts to 
						a force that is acting on it by generating an equally strong force in the opposite direction. 
						An example of the third law is when a rocket fires, the rocket pushes against the launch pad, which in turn pushes 
						at the rocket. Newton discovered gravity, which is the force that attracts objects to each other and keeps 
						ligher celestial bodies revolving around heavier ones, such as the moon around the Earth and the Earth 
						around the Sun. Legend has it that Newton discovered gravity when he was sitting under a tree and an 
						apple fell on his head! Using a prism Newton split light into a rainbow, and discovered that white 
						light is made up of the colors of the rainbow.

						As a mathematician, Newton formulated calculus in his book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica published in 1687. Calculus is the branch 
						of mathematics that solves problems that involve continuous change, and is today an indispensable part of science and engineering. Newton's work 
						in calculus begun when he tried to find the slope at any given point on a curve. To do so, he calculated the derivative, which he referred to as 
						the “method of fluxions” rather than differentiation. "Fluxion" is the term he used to refer to the instantaneous rate of change at any given point 
						on the curve, and "fluents" is the term he used to refer to the changing values of x and y. The opposite of differentiation is integration, which 
						he refered to as the “method of fluents”. Combining differentiation and integration, Newton formulated the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, 
						which says that if a function is integrated and then differentiated, then the original function can be obtained because differentiation and 
						integration are inverse functions.
